Welcome to the new Fall semester, and the DIGH 401 course *Intro to Computing*.

Please ensure that you check this website each week for new posts, notes, and material.

I shall also post each week's assignment to this website's [assignments & coursework](/assignments) page.

My contact details can be found on the [faculty page](http://www.luc.edu/cs/people/ftfaculty/haywardnicholas.shtml) at the CS department website, or using the link in the left sidebar.
